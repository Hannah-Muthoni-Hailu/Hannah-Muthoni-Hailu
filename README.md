- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hannah-Muthoni-Hailu
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Software Development and maybe Machine Learning or Cloud Development in future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fullstack webdev projects or software development projects using Python. Machine Learning Projects would be great too but keep in mind I'm a beginner at that.

- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her or whatever you feel like using.
